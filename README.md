# e-commerce-rest-api

This is a simple RESTful API project in Java. The REST API represents the basic operations for an e-commerce application.

The idea of this project is to learn about REST and that is why the project is splitted in branches with different progress through the stages.

* [1-Design](https://github.com/juanitodread/e-commerce-rest-api/tree/1-design)

* [2-Model](https://github.com/juanitodread/e-commerce-rest-api/tree/2-model)
  * All the model (POJOs) to represent the data of the application.

* [3-Persistence](https://github.com/juanitodread/e-commerce-rest-api/tree/3-persistence)
